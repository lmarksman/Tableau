Observations

When viewing the when the riders began you can notice an increase in frequency of riders as the summer months approach
Additionally beginning at about 3 in the afternoon is when riders began riding. Assuming this is the time when workers are returning home
or free time is beginning.

Mapping observations with times

In the very early mornings you can see very few riders. Assumption is people are sleeping
As the day starts people using the bikes may be commuting or are now free to use the equipment.

When viewing the Ride Duration by Station Dashboard it was interesting to see it seemed as the lesser popular stations
had longer ride durations.
